# TODO LIST


## Parser

- Support for multiple ckeys
- Options for filtering
    - Timestamp filtering (relative to roundstart)
    - Interaction filtering (ckey1 interacts with ckey2)
    - For later: Maybe instead of outputting a log file, create an md or another type of file supporting color coding?

## UI/UX

CLI works fine but not very user friendly for all admins, maybe a simple GUI? Including a simple file drag and drop for log.json fires.

## Animation

This is where I have no idea of implementation. Rig DM NPC logic to execute a list of procs fished from the logs?
